# AI-Image-Quiz

A simple quiz game. The purpose of it is to provide a fun way to get better at spotting images that are generated by AI.

The data I used for testing is from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images), but any dataset with clearly separated AI-generated images and non-AI generated will work.

### To run the website and try out the game:

- Edit the <i>ai_images_path</i> and <i>real_images_path</i> in the <b>app.py</b> backend to the paths of folders with images you would like to use.
- Run the <b>app.py</b> python script to start the server. Make sure to install any dependencies.
- Open the <b>index.html</b> file.
